3. **Notice the workflow organization options:**
   - **Projects:** Save workflows in different project folders
   - **Tags:** Organize workflows by categories (customer support, marketing, etc.)

### Understanding Triggers

**Every workflow must start with a trigger** - this determines when your workflow runs.

1. **Click "Add First Step"**
2. **Review trigger options:**
   - **Manual trigger** - run by clicking a button
   - **Event triggers** - new Telegram message, new CRM row, etc.
   - **Schedule triggers** - run at specific times (6 AM daily, etc.)
   - **Webhook triggers** - triggered by external API calls
   - **Form submissions**
   - **Chat messages**

3. **Select "Trigger Manually"** for this example
4. **Click "Test Workflow"** to see how the manual trigger works

### Adding Nodes to Your Workflow

#### Understanding Node Types

After your trigger, you can add different types of nodes:
- **Action nodes** - perform specific tasks
- **Data transformation nodes** - modify data
- **AI nodes** - interact with AI services
- **App integration nodes** - connect to external services

#### Adding an App Integration Node

1. **Click the plus button** after your trigger node
2. **Click "Take action within an app"**
3. **Browse the integrations** - you'll see hundreds of native integrations
4. **Click on "Google Drive"** as an example
5. **Review the available actions:**
   - Copy a file
   - Share a file
   - Create a shared drive
   - And many more natural language options

**Important:** Every app integration requires **credentials** (passwords/API keys) to connect.

#### Adding an AI Node Instead

1. **Delete the Google Drive node** by clicking the delete button
2. **Click the plus button** again
3. **Select "AI"** from the options
4. **Click "OpenAI"**
5. **Select "Message a model"**

### Configuring Your AI Node

#### Understanding Node Structure

Every node has three main sections:
- **Left (Input):** Data coming into this node
- **Middle (Configuration):** Settings and options for this node  
- **Right (Output):** Data produced by this node

#### Setting Up OpenAI Configuration

1. **Configure the resource type:** Select "Text"
2. **Choose the operation:** "Message a model"
3. **Notice the model limitation** with free n8n credits

### Getting Your Own OpenAI API Key

#### Creating an OpenAI API Account

1. **Go to openai.com**
2. **Create an account** (this is different from ChatGPT subscription)
3. **Look for "API Platform Login"** (not ChatGPT login)
4. **Navigate to your dashboard**
5. **Click "API Keys"** in the menu
6. **Click "Create New Key"**
7. **Name your key** (e.g., "n8n Demo")
8. **Copy the secret key**

**Important:** You must add billing information to your OpenAI account for the API key to work.

#### Adding Your API Key to n8n

1. **Return to your n8n workflow**
2. **In the OpenAI node, find the credential section**
3. **Click "Create New Credential"**
4. **Paste your API key**
5. **Name your credential** (e.g., "Demo May 21st")
6. **Save the credential**

### Configuring Your AI Model

1. **Select a model** from the dropdown (e.g., "GPT-4.1 Mini")
2. **In the prompt field, type:** "Tell me a joke"
3. **Click "Test Step"** to run just this node
4. **Review the output** in the right panel

### Understanding Data Views

You can view your data in three different formats:

#### Schema View
- **Most user-friendly**
- **Natural language format**
- **Easy drag-and-drop interface**

#### Table View  
- **Spreadsheet-like format**
- **Good for structured data**
- **Also supports drag-and-drop**

#### JSON View
- **Technical format**
- **Key-value pairs**
- **Universal format understood by all AI models**

### Working with Variables

#### Adding a Set Node

1. **Click the plus button** after your OpenAI node
2. **Select "Data Transformation"**
3. **Choose "Set"** node
4. **Click "Add Field"**
5. **Name the field:** "OpenAI's Response"

#### Using Drag-and-Drop Variables

1. **From the input panel (left side), drag the "content" field**
2. **Drop it into the "Value" field**
3. **Notice the green variable:** `{{ $json.message.content }}`
4. **Click "Test Step"** to see the output

**Key Concept:** Anything in green curly braces `{{ }}` is a **variable** representing dynamic data from previous nodes.

## Understanding JSON

### What is JSON?

**JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation** - it's a way to structure and identify data.

#### Why JSON Matters:
- **All workflows in n8n are built on JSON**
- **All major AI models understand JSON**
- **When you download templates, they're JSON files**
- **It's universal and standardized**

#### JSON Structure:
- **Key-value pairs:** `"key": "value"`
- **Natural language format:** `"role": "assistant"`
- **Nested structure:** Objects can contain other objects

### Getting Help with JSON

**Pro Tip:** If you ever need help understanding or creating JSON:

1. **Copy any JSON from n8n**
2. **Go to ChatGPT**  
3. **Ask:** "Help me understand this JSON" and paste it
4. **Or ask:** "Convert this natural language to JSON format"

#### Example JSON Creation:
**Input:** "My name is Nate, I'm 23 years old, I went to University of Iowa, I like to play pickleball"

**Output:**
```json
{
  "name": "Nate",
  "age": 23,
  "education": "University of Iowa", 
  "interests": "pickleball"
}
```

### Testing JSON in n8n

1. **Add another Set node**
2. **Instead of manual mapping, select "JSON"**
3. **Paste the JSON from ChatGPT**
4. **Click "Test Step"**
5. **See the structured output** in schema, table, and JSON views

## Creating a Dynamic Chat Workflow

### Switching from Manual to Chat Trigger

1. **Delete your manual trigger**
2. **Add a Chat trigger**
3. **Connect it to your OpenAI node** by dragging the plus sign
4. **Modify your OpenAI prompt:**
   - Delete "Tell me a joke"
   - **Drag the "chatInput" variable** from the input panel
   - **Drop it in the prompt field**

### Testing Your Dynamic Workflow

1. **Save your workflow**
2. **Open the chat**
3. **Type a message:** "My name is Nate, I like to eat ice cream. Make up a funny story about me."
4. **Watch the AI create a personalized response**

The AI will now respond dynamically to any input, just like ChatGPT in your browser.

## Workflow Management Features

### Understanding the Editor

**Top navigation shows "Editor"** - this is where you:
- **Zoom in and out**
- **Move around the canvas**
- **Edit your workflow visually**
- **Workflows flow left-to-right** (like reading)

### Viewing Execution History

1. **Click "Executions"** in the top navigation
2. **See all previous workflow runs**
3. **Click on any execution** to see:
   - **What time it ran**
   - **What data flowed through**
   - **Results from each node**
4. **Click into individual nodes** to see their specific input/output

This is invaluable for debugging and monitoring your automations.

## Active vs Inactive Workflows

### Understanding Workflow States

#### Inactive Workflows:
- **Only run when you click "Test Workflow"**
- **Don't execute automatically**
- **Good for testing and development**

#### Active Workflows:
- **Run automatically based on their triggers**
- **Count toward your execution limit**
- **Required for live automations**

### Making a Workflow Active

1. **Your workflow needs a trigger that supports activation:**
   - Schedule triggers
   - Webhook triggers  
   - App event triggers (new HubSpot contact, etc.)
   - **NOT manual triggers**

2. **Add a Schedule trigger example:**
   - Delete your current trigger
   - Add "Schedule" trigger
   - Set it to run "Every day at midnight"
   - **Toggle the "Active" switch** in the top right

3. **Understanding the activation message:**
   - **Executions will run on schedule**
   - **They won't show live in the editor**
   - **You'll see them in the Executions list**

**Critical:** If you want a workflow to run automatically (new contact, daily schedule, etc.), it **MUST be set to Active**.

## Working with Binary Data

### Understanding Binary Data

**Binary data** includes:
- **Images**
- **PDFs** 
- **Word documents**
- **PowerPoint files**
- **Videos**
- **Any non-text files**

### Creating a Form with File Upload

1. **Add a "Form Trigger"**
2. **Configure the form:**
   - **Title:** "Demo"
   - **Description:** "Binary Data"
3. **Add form elements:**
   - **Text field** for "Name" (required)
   - **File field** for "File" (required)
4. **Click "Test Step"** to generate the form

### Testing Binary Data

1. **Fill out the form** with your name
2. **Upload a file** (video, image, document, etc.)
3. **Submit the form**
4. **View the results in n8n:**
   - **Schema/Table/JSON views** show file metadata
   - **Binary view** shows the actual file content
   - **Click "View"** to see/download the actual file

### Working with Binary Data in Workflows

- **Binary data appears as a fourth tab** alongside Schema, Table, and JSON
- **You can reference binary data** in subsequent nodes
- **Many nodes can process binary data** (image recognition, PDF parsing, etc.)
- **Don't be intimidated** - binary is just another data type

## Key Takeaways
